* Langchain (as a foundation for AI agents)
* SerperDevTool (for web searching)
* Pint (for unit conversion)
* dotenv (for managing environment variables)
* YAML (for configuration)
* Supabase (for future user authentication)
* **(Future)** `streamlit-webrtc` (for voice input)
* **(Future)** Image generation API (e.g., DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd culinary-ai-assistant
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    * Add your Gemini API key:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
        ```
        **(For future Supabase integration)** Add your Supabase URL and Anon Key to `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (if running locally) or Streamlit Secrets (if deploying to Streamlit Cloud).

4.  **Run the backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python backend_flask.py
    ```
    The backend will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

5.  **Run the frontend:**
    Open a new terminal and navigate to the root directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The Streamlit app will open in your web browser (usually on `http://localhost:8501`).

## Configuration

The behavior of the AI assistant can be configured through the YAML files in the `cooking_crew/config` directory:

* `agents.yaml`: Defines the roles, goals, and backstories of the AI agents.
* `tasks.yaml`: Defines the descriptions and expected outputs of the various tasks.

Feel free to modify these files to experiment with different agent personalities and task instructions.

## Output

The output generated by the AI assistant (recipes, meal plans, etc.) is saved as Markdown files in the `output` directory.

## Future Enhancements

* Implement voice recognition for hands-free interaction.
* Integrate image generation to visually represent recipe suggestions.
* Enable user login and signup using Supabase for personalized experiences and data saving.
* Explore more advanced AI models and tools for enhanced accuracy and functionality.
* Add support for more grocery price comparison platforms.
* Develop a more sophisticated unit conversion interface.
* Expand the knowledge base for food history and nutritional information.
* Refine the local information feature with more detailed results and user reviews.
