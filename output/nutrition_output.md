**Ghee Mutton Nutritional Information (Approximate, per serving)**

Please note that the exact nutritional content can vary significantly based on the specific recipe, the cut of mutton used, the amount of ghee added, and portion sizes. This analysis is based on a common recipe consisting of mutton cooked in ghee with onions, ginger, garlic, spices (such as turmeric, chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala), and sometimes yogurt. A typical serving size is assumed to be around 150-200 grams of cooked mutton.

**Estimated Values:**

*   **Calories:** 450-650 kcal
*   **Protein:** 30-45g
*   **Fat:** 30-50g
    *   Saturated Fat: 15-25g (primarily from ghee and mutton fat)
*   **Carbohydrates:** 5-15g
*   **Fiber:** 1-3g
*   **Sugar:** 2-5g (primarily from onions and yogurt, if used)

**Detailed Breakdown and Considerations:**

1.  **Calories:** The high calorie count is mainly attributed to the generous use of ghee and the inherent fat content of mutton.

2.  **Protein:** Mutton is a rich source of high-quality protein, contributing significantly to the protein content per serving.

3.  **Fat:** Ghee is clarified butter and is almost pure fat. The type of mutton cut will influence the overall fat content. Fattier cuts like shoulder or leg will naturally increase the fat content, while leaner cuts from the loin or leg, with trimming, will lower the fat. A significant portion of the fat will be saturated due to the ghee.

4.  **Carbohydrates:** The carbohydrate content is relatively low. It primarily comes from ingredients like onions, garlic, ginger, tomatoes and yogurt (if used).

5.  **Fiber:** The fiber content is minimal, mainly from onions and other vegetables used in the recipe.

6.  **Sodium:** The sodium content can vary greatly depending on the amount of salt added during cooking and the use of any processed ingredients. It can range from 300-700mg or higher per serving if a lot of salt is used.

7.  **Other Micronutrients:** Ghee mutton will also provide:

    *   **Iron:** Mutton is a good source of iron.
    *   **Vitamin B12:** Also abundant in mutton.
    *   **Zinc:** Present in mutton.
    *   **Vitamin A & E:** Found in Ghee.
    *   **Calcium:** Can be present if yogurt is used.

**Factors Affecting Nutritional Content:**

*   **Type of Mutton:** Leaner cuts will reduce fat and calorie content.
*   **Amount of Ghee:** Reducing the amount of ghee significantly lowers the calorie and fat content.
*   **Added Ingredients:** The addition of yogurt, cream, or other ingredients will alter the nutritional profile.
*   **Portion Size:** Adjust the values proportionally based on the actual serving size consumed.
*   **Spices:** Spices contribute negligible calories but add flavor and potential health benefits.

**Recommendations for a Healthier Version:**

*   **Use Lean Mutton:** Opt for leaner cuts and trim visible fat.
*   **Reduce Ghee:** Use ghee sparingly. Consider using a combination of ghee and a healthier oil like olive oil in small quantities.
*   **Increase Vegetables:** Add more vegetables to increase fiber content and overall nutritional value.
*   **Control Sodium:** Be mindful of salt usage.
